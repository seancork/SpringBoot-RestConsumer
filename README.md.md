# RestConsumer

This project consumes two API endpoints (List all bids by user id & list all active jobs) from the [restMCV project](https://github.com/seancork/SpringBoot-RestMVC). It also has the ability to change the language and there is a form also to allow the user to input a user id to view all bids for that user. 

Note: You must first have [restMCV project](https://github.com/seancork/SpringBoot-RestMVC)  running, because this project uses its API to display data.
